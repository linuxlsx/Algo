My Algo Practice Code
========================

Insert sort
------------------------
complexity is O(n2)

performance adapts to the initial order of elements

insertion sort is used on quite small data sets

properties:

* stable : insertion sort retains relative order of the same elements
* in place

Select sort
------------------------
complexity is O(n2)

n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1, results in O(n2) number of comparisons. Number of swaps may vary from zero (in case of sorted array) to n - 1 (in case array was sorted in reversed order), which results in O(n) number of swaps. Overall algorithm complexity is O(n2).
